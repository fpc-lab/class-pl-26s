### Overview

- This course covers the basics of the **theory of programming languages**. We will begin with an introduction to functional programming and the mathematical foundation for programming language theory, and then proceed to the techniques for formally defining programming languages such as abstract syntax, operational semantics, and type systems.
- We will investigate important features found in modern programming languages and their implementation issues. This course places a strong emphasis on the role of **type theory** in modern programming languages. To complement our theoretical study with practical programming, we will learn a **higher-order functional language** in the ML family.

### Prerequisites

- **Requirements:** None, as this course is self-contained. However, familiarity with Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures, and Algorithms is recommended.
- **Expectations:** A strong interest in both Computer Science and Mathematics, and a strong willingness to learn new and challenging material.

### Grades

- **Attendance (5%):** You should ask 2+ questions in class (or after class) to get full credit.
- **Homework (65%):** You will have 9 programming assignments.
- **Exams (30%):** You will have a midterm exam (15%) and a final exam (15%).
