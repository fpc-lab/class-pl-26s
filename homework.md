# Homework

### Software

- **OCaml Installation**
    - Install **OCaml 5.4.0** (e.g., by following https://ocaml.org/install).
    - If you use another OCaml version, your code may **NOT** be graded correctly.
- **OCaml References**
    - [The OCaml Manual (by Xavier Leroy et al.)](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.4/index.html)
    - [포스텍 전자계산입문 강의노트 (by 박성우)](http://pl.postech.ac.kr/~gla/cs101/notes/all.pdf)

### Grading Criteria

- **Correctness:** Your program should satisfy the given specification.
- **Clarity:** Your program should be easy to read.
- **Efficiency is NOT important.**
    - Focus on elegance, not efficiency (unless otherwise instructed).
    - In particular, try to avoid using mutable references or arrays whenever possible so that your code remains “pure”. You may often be tempted to use them, but none of our assignments is designed to encourage their use. It is even safe to assume that if your code is not pure, you have not thought enough about the assignment!

### General Advice

- **Start your assignment early.**
    - Keep in mind that no late submissions will be accepted.
- **Think about the problem before typing anything on your screen.**
    - Spend enough time designing your code before you jump into coding. It is common to see that a well-designed specification automatically writes code for you.
